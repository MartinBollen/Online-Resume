<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h3>David Lloyd Leisure (2001 - 2009)</h3>
<p>I worked for David Lloyd Leisure from the age of 17, initially as a part time party co-ordinator at the Raynes Park site and eventually moved into several full time roles across multiple sites.
<p>Part time roles included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Childrens Party Co-ordinator</li>
        <li>Bartender</li>
        <li>Lane Controller</li>
    </ul>
<p>My first full time role with David Lloyd was as a maintenance operative, responsible for maintenance and reactive repair of the bowling lanes and the building.</p>
<p>After leaving David Lloyd in Raynes Park I held maintenance roles at the Brooklands and Hampton sites where I was charged with maintaining all elements of the sites including the swimming pools and spa facilities.</p>
<p>Maintaining and repairing the swimming pool and spa facilities was something I really enjoyed which led to me leaving David Lloyd and pursuing a career within the swimming pool indystry.</p>
    
<h3>London Swimming Pool Company (2009 - 2015)</h3>
<p>With my previous experience maintaining swimming pools and spa facilities I starte working for London Swimming Pools as a trainee and quickly established myself as a fully fledged engineer within 6 months.</p>
<p>The company operated primarily withing the residential swimming pool sector and I was charged with maintaining swimming pools for UHNW families. As my time progressed with London Swimming Pools and I gained more experience and confidence and took on roles with more responsibilities, taking a senoir engineer role before being promoted to Field Service Manager.</p>
<p>In this role I was responsible for leading a team of engineers of varying skill and knowledge levels, carrying out site visits to advise potential new clients, and scheduling works and training new staff.</p>

<h3>D G Pool & Leisure (20015 - 2018)</h3>
<p>After six years at London Swimming Pools it was time for a new challenge as I felt my knowledge level had plateued and with D G Pool & Leisure, who operate within hte commercial swimming pool sector, which would enable me to keep learning and become a better engineer.</p>
<p>I was charged with maintaining swimming pools, spas, saunas and steam rooms in hotels, schools, leaisure centres and health spas day to day.</p>

<h3>London Swimming Pool Company (2018 - 2019)</h3>
<p>I briefly returned to London Swimming Pools as an opportunity to join the new builds team presented itself and it was another opportunity to increase my skills. Although i did increase my skills and was charged with installing the swimming pool plant and first fix pipework - I realised that my true environment was the service and maintenance sector of the industry.</p>

<h3>D G Pool & Leisure (2019 - Present)</h3>
<p>I am now at D G pool and leisure, picking up where I left off and have progressed through the company, from Field Service Engineer, General Manager, and Sales & Projects manager.</p>
<p>My return to D G Pools has allowed me to increase my knowledge of how to analyse, design and project manage the installation of complex filtration, disinfection and monitoring systems, enhacing my abilities in management of teams and projects, liaising with customers to deliver what they want and build relationships with clients and suppliers alike.</p>
